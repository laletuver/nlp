# Sentiment, Frequency, and Collocation Analysis of 2016 US Presidential Election Tweets
# Overview
This repository contains the NLP project that I have completed for a University course. It focuses on analyzing the use of language by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 US Presidential Election campaign. Through a detailed examination of approximately 3000 tweets spanning from January 2016 to September 2016, this project employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to uncover insights into the sentiment, word frequency, and collocations present in these tweets. The aim is to provide a perspective on the candidates' communication strategies and highlight how they conveyed their messages and referred to each other in the lead-up to the election.

# Objectives and Features
- **Sentiment Analysis:** To compare the sentiment of tweets from both candidates, with a particular interest in identifying the negativity in Donald Trump's tweets. Utilized VADER and TextBlob to assess sentiment scores, focusing on polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and subjectivity.
- **Frequency Analysis:** To identify the most commonly used words by each candidate, highlight their core campaign messages.Employed NLTK to determine the most frequently occurring words in the candidates' tweets.
- **Collocation Analysis:** To explore how candidates refer to each other in their tweets, focusing on the words used in close association.Used NLTK to identify significant word pairs frequently appearing together.
